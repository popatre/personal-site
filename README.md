# Jonathan McGuire - Personal Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio website. 

It makes use of the following:
- HTML5
- SCSS/Sass (using mixins, variables and responsive media queries). The SCSS files were broken up for each page, to make the site easier to manage.
-Flexbox & Grid - both have been used for positioning and to aid responsivness. 
- JavaScript - used to make simple animations, such as the foldable nav bar and onclick card screens.
- Anime.js - the library was used via CDN to create the name animation on the main page.
- FontAwesome - Used via CDN for social icons
- Git/github - used for version control.

The site is hosted on Netlify.
